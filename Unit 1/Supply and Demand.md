## Law of Demand
---
As the price of a good rises, the quantity of the good consumers are willing and able to buy will decrease.

### Why will it decrease?
1. Substitution Effect -- Changes in price motivate consumers to buy relatively cheaper substitute goods.
2. Income Effect -- Changes in price affect the purchasing power of consumersâ€™ income.
3. Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility -- buyers consume a good, each additional unit consumes provides less utility (satisfaction)
## Law of Supply
---
As price rises, the quantity a seller is willing and able to sell will increase.

## The Intersection Point
--- 
This is the equilibrium market price.
	We can find equilibrium by looking where supply and demand intersect.
