## Output problems
---
Output problems state that you get a certain amount of product out of a given input.

## Input problems
---
Input problems state that it takes a certain amount of input to get a given product.

## Absolute Advantage
### For output problems: 
You look at if one nation (individual/company) can produce more output with the same resources as the other.

### For Input Problem:
You look at who uses the least amount of input to get the output.

## Comparative Advantage
An individual, business, or country can produce a good or service at a lower [[Economics#Opportunity Cost|Opportunity Cost]] than another producer.
Opportunity Cost will always be expressed in the **good** not the input.
One actor cant have the comparative advantage in both situations.  

# Terms of Trade
The rate by which one unit of a good or service is traded for another unit of a good or service.
The Terms of Trade will only be beneficial to both producers if the exchange rate falls between both of their opportunity cost.

## Finding Mutually Beneficial Terms of Trade
1. Calculate the opportunity costs and identify which nations have the comparative advantage.
	1. A nation which has comparative advantage in something should specialize in that something. 
2. Pick a good in which the opportunity costs of both are whole numbers
3. Mutually Beneficial Terms of Trade will be between the 2 opportunity costs.

# Consumption Possibilities
- Combinations of goods and services that could be consumed. 
- People in the nations have greater access to the two goods than they did before.
