## FOUR Types of Resources
| Word | Description |
| :--: | ---- |
| Land | Natural Resources |
| Labor | Human Resources |
| Capital | Physical things used to make goods and services. |
| Entrepreneurs | People who combine resources to create new goods and services. |
Together they are called the "productive resources" or "factors of production".

A type of labor is Human Capital -- A person's "economic value".

## Goods and Services
Productive resources are used to produce goods and services.

### Goods
----
Useful, tangible items that satisfy needs/wants
#### Consumer Goods
<u>Final intended use</u>: Used by the consumers. 

#### Capital Goods
<u>Final intended use</u>: Used to create to produce other goods.

### Services
----
An activity performed for a fee

## Cost
---
**TINSTAAFL** -- "There is no such thing as a free lunch."
(Everything has a cost)

### Trade Off
---
By making a choice, you give something up.

### Opportunity Cost
---
The value of the next best alternative that had to be given up for the alternative that was chosen. [[Formulas#Opportunity Cost|Formula]]

### How do people decide what to do?
---
Cost-benefit analysis --- weighing pros & cons

# Production Possibilities Curve (Frontier)
Used to show the trade-offs associated with allocating scarce resources. 
The PPC is a model (graph) used to show the trade-offs  associated with allocating scarce resources.

## Constant Opportunity Costs
---
The opportunity cost of producing another unit of a product does not change.

## Increasing Opportunity Costs
---
As more and more of a good are produced it takes more away from the other because the resources are not easily converted.

## Decreasing Opportunity Costs
---
The opportunity cost of producing a product decreases. This is often associated with increased technology that is gained in other areas.

If you are moving along the curve, then to increases the production of one resources you must decrease the production of another.

| Location on the curve | Meaning |
| ---- | ---- |
| On the curve | Efficient level of production |
| Inside  | Inefficient level of production |
| Outside | Impossible / Unsustainable   |
## PPC Shift
### Increased Production
---
If a nationâ€™s ability to produce capital goods and consumer goods if it has new technology and more workers the PPC will shift outward and to the right. (Economic growth) 
#### Causes:
- More resources
- Better production techniques

### Decreased Production
---
#### Causes:
- Fewer resources
- Not using better or innovative production techniques
