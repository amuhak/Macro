The slope of the demand curve. 
The sensitivity of consumers to a change in price of a product. 

# Luxuries vs Necessities
If something is a necessity a change in price wont really effect demand (inelastic)
The opposite is also true. 

# Availability of substitutes.
The greater the number of substitute the more elastic the product.

# Proportion of income
The greater the price of a good relative to one's budget, the greater the elasticity of demand.

# Time  
The longer the time period the more elastic a demand curve becomes. A person will not run out and buy a smaller car if the price of gas goes up. Instead they will wait until their older car wears out.
