# Taxes and GDP
Our tax system is such that net tax revenues change directly with GDP.
Taxes yield more revenue when GDP increase.
- Tax revenues decrease automatically as GDP falls, preventing consumption and the economy from falling further.
- Tax revenues increase automatically as GDP rises, slowing consumption and preventing the economy from overheating.
