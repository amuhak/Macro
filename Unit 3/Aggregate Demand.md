# Why is it downward sloping?
## **Real Wealth Effect**
When prices fall the money that people have will  be worth more. (The real value will be worth more.) And vice versa

## Interest-Rate Effect
As the price level rises so will the interest rate.
- This will reduce consumption. (This is because the higher prices means consumers (business, individuals...) will need more money.)
 - They will seek to borrow it and this will drive up interest rates. (We will learn about this in detail next unit) 
## Exchange Rate Effect
When price levels in the  United States increase this means U.S. prices are higher than foreign prices.
- Purchase of exports will decrease causing the amount of Goods and Services demanded to decrease

# Shifts
## Consumer Spending
### Consumer Wealth
When people have less money to save, this causes the curve to shift to the left. (decrease in AD)
### Consumer Expectations
If people think that their future income will decrease or that inflation will decrease (it will be cheaper to buy later) they will spend less now.
### Consumer Indebtedness
If people have spent a lot in the past and are in debt they are going to spend less now. This will shift the curve to the left.
