# Why is it downward sloping?
## **Real Wealth Effect**
When prices fall the money that people have will  be worth more. (The real value will be worth more.) And vice versa

## Interest-Rate Effect
As the price level rises so will the interest rate.
- This will reduce consumption. (This is because the higher prices means consumers (business, individuals...) will need more money.)
 - They will seek to borrow it and this will drive up interest rates. (We will learn about this in detail next unit) 
## Exchange Rate Effect
When price levels in the  United States increase this means U.S. prices are higher than foreign prices.
- Purchase of exports will decrease causing the amount of Goods and Services demanded to decrease

# Shifts
## Consumer Spending
### Consumer Wealth
When people have less money to save, this causes the curve to shift to the left. (decrease in AD)
### Consumer Expectations
If people think that their future income will decrease or that inflation will decrease (it will be cheaper to buy later) they will spend less now.
### Consumer Indebtedness
If people have spent a lot in the past and are in debt they are going to spend less now. This will shift the curve to the left.
### Taxes
If taxes increase the people have less money and will then spend less. AD shifts to the left
### Interest Rate
When interest rates increase AD decreases
## Investment Spending
### Interest Rates
Increase in interest rates will decrease AD (Business will buy  less capital goods).
### Profit Expectations on Investment Projects
If the business foresee profits  for investment they will increase demand for capital goods. This will shift  the AD curve.
### Business Taxes
Increase business taxes will lead to a decrease in  investment spending and the AD curve will shift to left.
### Technology
New technology increases investment spending.
### Amount of Excess Capacity
If they are not using the capital they have they will not purchase new capital.
## Government Spending
Increased government spending (without change in taxes or interest rates) will increase AD.
## Net Exports
### Income Abroad
Increase in foreign demand will cause an increase in AD for U.S.
### Exchange Rates
If the dollar becomes worth less (depreciates) in terms to another currency. This means they have more real income and our AD will increase.
