# Short Run
Relationship between price level and the quantity of goods and services supplied.
The Short Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) curve is upward-sloping

Moving along the SRAS curve, an increase in the price level  is associated with an increase in output.
Firms can earn more profits when price levels increases. Wages are fixed, prices are rising.

### Why are input costs fixed?
- Wages tend to change annually.
Same with deflation. Price of output falls, no change in input costs.

## Determinants
### Change in Input Prices
- Availability of resources
- Price of imported resources
- Market power -- The ability to set a price above the point that would be reached in a competitive environment. (Monopoly)
### Change in Legal-Institutional Environment
- Business taxes and subsidies
- Government Regulation
### Aggregate Supply
#### Changes in productivity
Productivity = real output/input
- Technology 
- Investments in Human Capital 
- Production Techniques (specialization/Division of Labor)
